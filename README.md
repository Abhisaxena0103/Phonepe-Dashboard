# Phonepe-Dashboard
PhonePe - End to End Data Analysis Project | Best Power BI Project for Data Analysts |
1. Project Overview

This project analyzes PhonePe transaction data to understand digital payment trends across different states, districts, and time periods in India. The objective is to derive insights into user adoption, transaction behavior, and growth patterns of digital payments.

2. Data Collection & Preparation

The dataset was sourced from publicly available PhonePe transaction records. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps included handling missing values, formatting date and location fields, and aggregating transaction metrics to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to examine transaction volumes, transaction values, and user distribution across regions. Visual and statistical techniques were used to identify trends, regional differences, and time-based growth in digital transactions.

4. Tools & Technologies Used

The analysis was performed using Python for data manipulation and analysis, SQL for structured querying, and data visualization tools (such as Power BI ) to create clear and interactive dashboards representing key metrics.

5. Insights & Key Findings

The project highlights significant growth in digital payments, identifies top-performing states and districts, and reveals seasonal and yearly transaction trends. These insights help understand consumer behavior and the expansion of digital payment platforms in India.
